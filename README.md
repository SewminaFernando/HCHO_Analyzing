# Analysis of Tropospheric Formaldehyde (HCHO) in Sri Lanka
This project involves analyzing the distribution and trends of HCHO, a harmful air pollutant, across various cities in Sri Lanka <b>(Colombo, Jaffna, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Bibla, Kurunegala & Deniyaya)</b> using data engineering and machine learning techniques.

### Tasks Completed:
#### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded data from the Sentinel-5P satellite for seven cities.
- Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
- Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each city.
- Visualized data distributions using histograms and boxplots.
  
#### 2. Spatio-Temporal Analysis:
- Analyzed seasonal and long-term trends in HCHO levels across the cities.
- Investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on HCHO emissions.
- Correlated HCHO levels with external factors like weather data and anthropogenic activities.
- Compared spatial patterns of HCHO distribution among different cities considering factors like population density and proximity to the sea.
  
#### 3. Machine Learning:
- Developed time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future HCHO levels.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.
- Incorporated relevant external factors to enhance prediction accuracy.

#### 4. Communication and Insights:
- Created a comprehensive report summarizing findings with visualizations and data tables.
- Discussed data limitations and uncertainties in the analysis.
- Recommended potential uses of findings for policymaking and further research.
- Developed an interactive web application to visualize and explore the data.

#### Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook documenting the analysis and code.
- Report (PDF) summarizing key findings, visualizations, and recommendations.
- Interactive Web Application for data visualization and exploration.
